# Findin' Bus Times
Find the number of minutes until a bus on a given route going a given direction leaves a given stop.

## Prep
Install the following libraries and frameworks using **pip** for Python3
```
urllib3
Django
```

## Execution
Download the repo and run from command line with the following:
```
> cd %PATH%/tr-api/WebApp
> python manage.py runserver
```
Navigate to the IP address output by the command line. Likely http://127.0.0.1:8000/

There will be three text inputs and a "Countdown!" button. Fill out the form for the proper bus parameters and click the button

**Note:** The program assumes all input is comprised of valid options and no errors are made on the user's part.
